<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Several of the rhymed stories in this book are true stories, and children may
enjoy them the more for knowing that Barney, a real donkey, did run away and
play pranks as the rhymes say; that Midget did ride horseback; that the deer
did toss the hay to the hungry pony; and that Queen Victoria did restore the
birds' nesting-place in the old round tower at Windsor. Pony Rollo, too, is a real
character, clever and lovable, although some liberties have been taken in the
portrayal of him and his doings. Barney Gray is still living, petted by his now
grown-up owners and enjoyed by all children who visit the farm to which the
donkey came about twenty years ago, and a drive with Barney is quite as likely
now as in former days to have unexpected features.</p>

<p>The pictures of Barney and some of the other pets have been drawn by
Mr. Bridgman from photographs taken expressly for this book.</p>

<p>In the belief that such rhymes as are herein offered gratify and increase in
children both the love of animals and the sense of humor, this new volume is sent
forth not only to give pleasure, but to contribute what it may to the fostering of
these desirable traits.</p>

<p>Kindergartners will find here, as in <i>Through the Farmyard Gate</i>, suitable
material for kindergarten use; for example, the cumulative rhyme, <i>The Pigeons</i>,
and the tracing-back rhyme, <i>Who Gives us Our Thanksgiving Dinner?</i></p>

<p>For courteous permission to use such of these rhymes as have already appeared
in print, acknowledgments are made to publishers and periodicals as follows: The
Century Company, New York (<i>St. Nicholas</i>); S. E. Cassino, Salem, Massachusetts
(<i>Little Folks</i>); and Milton Bradley Co., Springfield, Massachusetts (<i>Kindergarten
Review</i>).<br /></p>

<h2>OLD BARNEY'S LATEST PRANK</h2>



<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One sunny winter morning<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The air was crisp and still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And snow on snow lay drifted deep<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On every road and hill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In cosy stable comfort<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Stood Barney, groomed and fed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But wistful thoughts of out-of-doors<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Were in his long-eared head.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To be a beast of leisure<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is elegant, no doubt,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thought Barney, "but it's very dull."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Just then he heard a shout,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A battering and banging,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then doors were opened wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And madcap Helen and her chum<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rushed noisily inside.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where's Barney? Where's the harness?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And where's the Barney sleigh?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See, Minna, here's our donkey dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We'll have some fun to-day."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The donkey soon was harnessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And loud their laughter rang,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As up into the outgrown sleigh<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The jolly comrades sprang.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The sleigh-bells jingled gayly,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And many a compliment<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did Barney get as o'er the snow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At steady pace he went.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"How very good and docile,"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Said Minna, "Barney is!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never thought he'd settle down,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
<span class="i2">To be as staid as this!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He does seem tame," said Helen,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"It's very strange to think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he's too old for playing jokes."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(Here Barney gave a wink.)<br /></span>
</div></div>


<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/076.jpg" alt="The sleigh-bells jingled gayly" style="width: 50%" /></div>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But what a day for coasting!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And isn't this a climb?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just think how we'll spin down the hill&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We'll have the gayest time."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Up, up the hill toiled Barney,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The long, steep, slipp'ry road;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sleigh with those substantial girls<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was not an easy load.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At last with tugs and straining<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He reached the very top,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Barney to his great delight<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was here allowed to stop.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here, too, he was unharnessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As if to have a rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What work the girls had planned for him<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Old Barney never guessed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He'll follow," said his mistress,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"He loves to follow so.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He'll chase right on behind the sleigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As coasting down we go.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then when we're at the bottom&mdash;"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No more did Barney hear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They'd let him follow as he liked,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Enough that this was clear.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A push&mdash;the sleigh went speeding<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Adown the coasting place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Come, Barney! Good old fellow! Come!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Come on! You like to chase."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then nothing loth, old Barney<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Behind the coasters ran.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thought he, "For girls and donkey too.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This is a jolly plan."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/078.jpg" alt="Come, Barney! Good old fellow! Come!" style="width: 50%" /></div>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"They knew I'd like this scamper;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They're kind, I do declare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some children would have coasted down<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And left me tied up there."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Full soon they reached the bottom,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The girls and Barney too;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Barney learned to his dismay,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What now he had to do.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For speedily they hitched him<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Into the sleigh, and then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Aha! old Barney," shouted they,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Now drag us up again."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In meekness puzzled Barney<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Submitted to their will.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps this time the girls would drive<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Right on beyond the hill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With pulling, tugging, straining,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Once more he reached the top,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But scarcely long enough to breathe<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was he allowed to stop.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The girls with nimble fingers<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Unhitched him from the sleigh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Come, Barney! Follow us again,"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He heard his mistress say.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Well, following was pleasant,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So, when they made a start,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He scampered after, gay and free,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
<span class="i2">With mischief in his heart.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet when they reached the bottom,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So staid he looked and meek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That naught seemed farther from his mind<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Than joke or prank or freak.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, this is fun!" said Helen,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"I'll always coast this way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hate to trudge back up the hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And drag the sled or sleigh."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yes, that's the worst of coasting,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That tedious uphill climb;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Barney saves us all that tug,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Let's coast a long, long time."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They meant to harness Barney,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And start at once uphill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Barney thought the time had come<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His own plan to fulfil.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, just before his mistress<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The flying rein could seize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Barney gave a sudden leap,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Escaping her with ease.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Whoa, Barney!" shouted Helen,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When off he clashed, "Whoa, whoa!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And both the girls chased after him<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As fast as they could go.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Barney sped the faster,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With feet as swift and light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if he had grown young again;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Soon he was out of sight.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And as he scampered homeward,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He thought with gleeful mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of how he'd turned the joke on them,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The girls he'd left behind.<br /></span>
